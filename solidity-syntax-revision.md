# Keywords
## Asset accessibility
* Public - Accessible from everywhere
* Private - Only from the contract the asset is in, not from child contracts
* Internal - Only from the contract and from the child contracts
* External - Accessible only from the outside 

## Functions
* Virtual - the asset that has to be overridden by a child contract
* Override - the asset that overrides inherited assets marked as `virtual` previously
* Pure - function that doesnâ€™t use any asset from contract

## Variables
* Calldata - Variables declared as `calldata` cannot be modified. This makes it a safe choice when you only need to read data without altering
* Memory - the memory keyword is used to define a temporary location for data storage that is only valid for the lifetime of a function call. When you use memory, the data is not persisted after the function execution ends, which makes it ideal for temporary or intermediate computations
