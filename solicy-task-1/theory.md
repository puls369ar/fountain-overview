* `Fountain` and `ModernTreasury` are both deFi dApps that work with each other and help in reward distribution. They exist in different blockchain platforms, but I research Polygon's instances for our case
* So as I get `Fountain` is a feature in LIF3 that later was separated as a smart contract in different blockchains
* Default swapper of `Tomb` is lif3

# Chains

* Research Fantom Ecosystem

# Questions
* In IUniswapV2Factory there are `<LIF3> additions` section. What is the relation between these two
* Term `Treasury` used so much in the contents is the same `ModerTreasury` dApp?
* I dont get the math behind. How this logic is called, I want to research better ![image](https://github.com/puls369ar/soliciy-tasks/blob/main/solicy-task-1/image.png)
* `currentEpoch()` and `nextEpochPoint()` functions described in Fountain's `IModernTreasury` remind me of the logic I didn't understand in the diagramm. I urgently need to understand 3th question's problem
